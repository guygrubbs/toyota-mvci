# Security and Legal

This project is for legitimate hardware enablement and diagnostics plumbing:
- It installs USB drivers and registers a J2534 PassThru DLL.

It does NOT provide:
- cracked OEM software
- immobilizer bypasses
- seed/key generation shortcuts
- any method to defeat security access controls

If you are doing key/immobilizer programming on late-model vehicles, ensure you use the proper OEM
processes, subscriptions, and authorizations required in your jurisdiction.
